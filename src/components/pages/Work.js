        <p>Affirming Educational Policies: Transgender and Non-Binary Students’ Sense of Belonging in K-12 Education Systems
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Abstract
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the United States, there has been a significant rise in legislation targeting transgender and non-binary youth. Educational policy has a direct impact on students’ sense of belonging, and even more so for marginalized transgender and non-binary students. This literature review highlights the basics of educational policy development, while demonstrating the impact of educational policy on transgender and non-binary students’ sense of belonging in public schools. Finally, the review concludes with the significance of the work and a call to action for school district leaders.</p>
